# The RUSTY NEAT Branch
NEAT is essentially a simple program, since attempts to add some of the data packages from Python met with memory issues, time issues and more. As such, it required us to code NEAT in a way that would potentially translate well to a systems-level language such as C++ or Rust. Because of the desire to multi-thread NEAT, and the helpful way rust builds both thread parallelization and thread safety into their code, it is an appealing option to recreate NEAT and hopefully gain some speed and parallelization.

Check this branch for updates or submit a request to contribute code directly. There won't be any solid tasks yet until we're further along in development.
