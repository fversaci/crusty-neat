Contributing to rusty-neat
====================

We welcome contributions to the rusty-neat project. Before contributing, please review our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

Note that this is a reworking of the NEAT project (https://github.com/ncsa/neat) purely in Rust. See the [README](README.md) for more details.

Contributing
------------

This effort is directed at reworking NEAT using the Rust language and Cargo package framework. This effort will take advantage of open source code where possible and will likely be rough, as this is our first major Rust undertaking. As such, we don't yet have a ticketing system or a firm plan in place, but we'll update as it becomes available. If you would like to contribute, you may message Joshua Allen (see links on page) and we can discuss.
