Contributing to RustyNeat
====================

We welcome contributions to the NEAT project. Before contributing, please review our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

Note that this is a special branch of NEAT where we are recoding some of the main code in Rust. See the [README](README.md) for more details.

Contributing
------------

This effort is directed at recoding NEAT using the Rust language and Carge package framework. This effort will take advantage of open source code where possible and will likely be rough, as this is our first major Rust undertaking. As such, we don't yet have a ticketing system or a firm plan in place, but we'll update as it becomes available. If you would like to contribute, you may message Joshua Allen (see links on page) and we can discuss.
